timestamp
=========

Sublime Text 2 plug-in for TimeStamps.  A repo from the Gist.  It adds a 
handy timestamp to Sublime 2.  Type 'now<tab>' for a quick timestamp.


This is a repo made from my gist (https://gist.github.com/merriam/5882679).   While a repository for
the one file is overkill, the gist does not allow Pull Requests.   This means there are several related gists, but
older ones never fix their bugs.

#.  To install this:
       Sublime's menu Tools -> New Plugin..., 
       Paste this gist over the sample given (use the raw button to see the gist as text)
       Save the file in your Sublime Packages directory.   File -> Save As.. should suggest
       an appropriate spot.  I recommend the name timestamp.py
       All done.  It should work immediately.
#.  To use this:
       Type "date" and hit tab.  Also try the words `isoD`, `now`, `datetime`, `utcnow`, `utcdatetime`,
       `date` and `time` followed by tab.  You may have to hit tab twice if you have another symbol in
       your current namespace.
