timestamp
=========

Sublime Text 2 plug-in for TimeStamps.  A repo from the Gist.  It adds a 
handy timestamp to Sublime 2.  Type 'now<tab>' for a quick timestamp.


This is a repo made from my gist (https://gist.github.com/merriam/5882679).   While a repository 
for the one file is overkill, the gist does not allow Pull Requests.   This means there are 
several related gists, butolder ones never fix their bugs.   The original code was written by Rob 
Crowie (https://gist.github.com/robcowie) and then fixed by reima (https://gist.github.com/reima).

#.  To install this:
       Sublime's menu Tools -> New Plugin..., 
       Paste this gist over the sample given (use the raw button to see the gist as text)
       Save the file in your Sublime Packages directory.   File -> Save As.. should suggest
       an appropriate spot.  I recommend the name timestamp.py
       All done.  It should work immediately.
#.  To use this:
       Type "date" and hit tab.  Also try the words `isoD`, `now`, `datetime`, `utcnow`, `utcdatetime`,
       `date` and `time` followed by tab.  You may have to hit tab twice if you have another matching symbol 
       in your current namespace.
