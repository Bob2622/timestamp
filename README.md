timestamp
=========

Sublime Text 2 plug-in for TimeStamps.  A repo from the Gist.  It adds a 
handy timestamp to Sublime 2.  Type 'now<tab>' for a quick timestamp.


This is a repo made from my gist (https://gist.github.com/merriam/5882679).   While a repository for
the one file is overkill, the gist does not allow Pull Requests.   This means there are several related gists, but
older ones never fix their bugs.
